## About
This project demonstrates the use of **WorkManager** in an Android application. WorkManager is a part of Android Jetpack that provides a simple and efficient way to schedule deferrable, asynchronous background tasks that must be executed reliably.

## Description
This project focuses on implementing WorkManager to handle background tasks effectively. WorkManager is used for tasks such as:
- Periodic data synchronization
- Uploading logs or files
- Executing long-running tasks in the background

WorkManager ensures task execution under system constraints like network availability, battery optimization, and device conditions.

## WorkManager Implementation in Android

### Features
